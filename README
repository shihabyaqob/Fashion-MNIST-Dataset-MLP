# Fashion-MNIST Dataset

This repository contains the Fashion-MNIST dataset of Zalando's article images. The dataset consists of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. The purpose of this dataset is to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

# Dataset Description

Each image in the dataset is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels. Each pixel has a single pixel value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers indicating darker. This pixel value is an integer between 0 and 255. The training and test data sets have 785 columns. The first column consists of the class labels (0-9), representing the article of clothing. The rest of the columns contain the pixel values of the associated image.

To locate a pixel on the image, we can decompose x as x = i \* 28 + j, where i and j are integers between 0 and 27. The pixel is located on row i and column j of a 28 x 28 matrix. For example, pixel 31 indicates the pixel that is in the fourth column from the left and the second row from the top.

# Labels

Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

0: T-shirt/top
1: Trouser
2: Pullover
3: Dress
4: Coat
5: Sandal
6: Shirt
7: Sneaker
8: Bag
9: Ankle boot

# Files

This repository contains the following files:

fashion-mnist_train.csv: the training set
fashion-mnist_test.csv: the test set
sample_submission.csv: a sample submission file in the correct format
Usage
To download and use this dataset, you can clone this repository or download the CSV files directly. Here's an example of how to load the dataset using Python:

# python

import pandas as pd

Load the training data:
train_data = pd.read_csv('fashion-mnist_train.csv')

Load the test data:
test_data = pd.read_csv('fashion-mnist_test.csv')
